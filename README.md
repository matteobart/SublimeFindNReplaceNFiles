# SublimeFindNReplaceNFiles
The faster (better) way to use Sublime to Find &amp; Replace in multiple files

A small Sublime 3 plugin that allows users to quickly Find & Replace right from the `Find in Files` 
tool. As Uncle Ben once said, 'with great power comes great responsibilty.'

# Why
I was once asked to make one small change to a large number of files. The task was essentially to do a quick find and replace 
that spanned about 70 files. Using the Find & Replace in All Files worked okay, but it was more effort than it 
should have been. It opens up all the relevent files and makes you check each one and close each one individually. Does this 
work well with 3 files? Yes. Does this work well with 20 file? Ehh. Does it work well with 70 files? Nope. I also had to
manually revert back a few of the files. Hopefully this plugin is the solution.
